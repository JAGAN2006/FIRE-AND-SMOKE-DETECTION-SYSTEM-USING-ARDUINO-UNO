# FIRE-AND-SMOKE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO-UNO
**ðŸ”¥ Fire and Smoke Detection System using Arduino Uno**

This project is designed to detect fire and smoke using an MQ2 sensor and a fire sensor connected to an Arduino Uno. The system displays the smoke intensity and fire status on an I2C LCD display and activates a buzzer alert when smoke or fire is detected.

**ðŸ§  Working Principle**

* The MQ2 sensor measures smoke concentration in the air.

* The fire sensor detects flame using infrared light.

* When fire or high smoke levels are detected, the buzzer activates and the LCD displays the alert status.

* The system continuously updates both fire and smoke readings in real time.

**ðŸ’» Features**

* Real-time smoke and fire monitoring

* Visual alert via LCD display

* Audible buzzer alarm for safety

* Adjustable smoke sensitivity

* Compact and easy to build

**ðŸ“Ÿ LCD Display Output Example**

Smoke: _HIGH_
Fire: _DETECTED_

or

Smoke: _LOW_
Fire: _NONE_

**ðŸ§¾ Use Case**

Can be used in homes, labs, and small industries as an early fire-warning system.

Ideal for students learning IoT and embedded system safety applications.
